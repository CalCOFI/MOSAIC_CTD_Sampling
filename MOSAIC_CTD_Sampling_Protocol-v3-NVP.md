## BACKGROUND

### Summary

This protocol describes the sampling of marine eDNA from water sampled from a CTD Niskin bottle. This protocol was used on CalCOFI cruises, but could be adapted for use on any research vessel with a CTD. The end result of this protocol is filters with preserved eDNA from seawater from whatever depth the selected Niskin bottle triggered at.

### Method description and rationale

This protocol describes sampling eDNA from a Niskin bottle sample. Water is sampled from the Niskin bottle and brought into the ship's lab. There, the sample is placed somewhere secure and a tube with a serological pipette on the end is placed in the sample. The other end of the tube must have a nut attachment, which is then attached to a Swinnex filter housing with a filter in it, and the tube is run through a peristaltic pump to pump the sample water through the filter. The filter, now containing environmental DNA, is preserved.

### Spatial coverage and environment(s) of relevance

This protocol can be used on any oceanographic research vessel with a CTD or similar water sampler.

## PERSONNEL REQUIRED

One person with pipetting experience. Research vessel experience is recommended but not required. Two people can sample 24/7.

### Safety

There are no major safety concerns with this protocol. Proper PPE should be worn at all times, especially when sterilizing equipment with bleach. Appropriate work gear should be worn on deck and near the CTD according to the vessel's protocol.

### Training requirements

Standard molecular biology training including sterile technique and pipetting technique is required to properly conduct this protocol. Research vessel experience is recommended. In-person training in this method prior to the cruise is recommended.

### Time needed to execute the procedure

The process of taking the sample should take approximately 5-10 minutes. Filtering the sample may take anywhere from 15-60 minutes depending on particulate and chlorophyll concentration in the seawater and functionality of the peristaltic pump. Preserving the sample should take approximately 10-15 minutes.

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Notes
- At every station, there will be a CTD cast. This cast will capture water in Niskin bottles from multiple depths. If your schedule allows, you should sample water from bottles taken at different depths, mix these samples, and filter them in the same way as you are filtering the underway water sample water from the surface bottle and filter it using the peristaltic pump. See below for full protocol.

### Time Management
- Setup at the beginning of a shift:
  - Use DNAway to wipe down the hood, pipette, DNA/RNA Shield bottle, and anything else you touch a lot (See Step 2 below)
  - Swap out the shop towel
- Before each station (30-60 mins before):
  - Check the protocol and any plans you have for replicates so you know what you're doing on station
  - Check with CTD team and ask if you could have a second surface Niskin bottle taken if they have a spare
  - Make sure you've bleached enough equipment to use on station: Enough housings for the samples you'll take, the tubing you use for CTD filtering, forceps
  - Keep an eye on the ship's speed! Depending on the ship, starting and stopping could be very smooth and tough to notice.
- On station:
  - Check your latitude and longitude, take a picture or write it down
  - Record or ask when the CTD goes down and comes up
  - After everyone else has taken CTD samples (this may be after station), take a whirlpak or ziplock bag full of water from the shallowest bottle
- Leaving station:
  - Check latitude and longitude, take a picture or write it down
  - Filter CTD water from the bag into a filter housing and hold the waste water in something to measure the volume filtered
- During spare time:
  - Sterilize housings and forceps
  - Data entry (try to do at least once per day)
  - Check with marine mammal observers, note sightings and audio detections
- End of shift:
  - If working alone, make a note of any issues, clean up and secure station.
  - If working shifts, pass on any information about equipment issues and current samples running.

### Sampling Protocol

#### Setup

1. Set up the hood for your clean work space. This is where you will assemble the new filters + housings, and transfer the filters from the housings to the cryovials.
2. Decontaminate the inside the hood thoroughly using DNAway or bleach. Spray the solution, let sit for 10 minutes, and wipe down.
3. Wipe down your forceps, cleaning solutions, P1000 pipet and tips, DNA/RNA Shield bottle, Sharpies and anything else you will use consistently in the hood before storing them inside.
4. After the hood has been decontaminated, keep it closed at all times unless working in it.

#### CTD Water Filtration

There may be extra water available from the CTD cast, particularly from deeper bottles. If this happens during your shift and you have the time and ability to do so, you can sample this extra water for a direct comparison with the underway samples.
With the new CTD, you may also be able to request an additional Niskin at the surface for eDNA sampling. Make sure to request this before bottles are prepped (this time will be written on the whiteboard in the main lab)
Check with the CalCOFI technicians which bottle numbers have extra water available.

1. Sample at least 1 L water from 3-5 bottles or 3 L from one surface bottle; they can be from different depths.
2. From each bottle: open the valve at the bottom of the Niskin bottle. Allow water to flow for 5-10 seconds and use the flow through to rinse your collection bottle 3x. without collecting it. Place your collection container under the flow and collect ~1-3 L. Close the valve, move to the next bottle, repeat.
    - Alternatively, use a sterile whirlpak instead of a bottle
3. Record the bottle numbers, depths and volume sampled from each bottle. From the CTD console, you should also record latitude and longitude in decimal degrees, CTD cast number, and the time the CTD was pulled up.
4. Mix the sample container by swirling it around.
5. Take the sample into the lab and use it as the source water for your filter. Perform the filtration by running a tube through the peristaltic pump, with a serological pipette tip in the sample and a nut attachment connecting the other end of the tube to a Swinnex filter housing.
    - Use separate tubing connected to a serological pipette tip with the cotton filter removed.
    - Only clamp the tube down in the peristaltic pump when actively filtering. This prevents additional wear and tear on the tube.
6. Measure the filtrate volume using the graduated cylinder and mark the filtration end time. This is very important!
7. In the PCR hood, set out your forceps decontamination kit: 4 x 50 mL Falcon tubes containing DNAway, water (x 2 tubes), and 100% EtOH, in that order.
8. Detach the Swinnex housing + filter from the tubing and bring them into the hood.
9. Label a cryovial with the cruise number and filter number.
10. In the hood, disassemble the Swinnex and transfer the filter into a labeled cryovial. Decontaminate your forceps by dipping them sequentially into the Falcon tubes before touching the filter. Label the tube - see below for the labeling scheme.
    - Roll the filter into a little tube or fold into eighths and stick into the cryovial. It is helpful to use two sets of forceps for this. See video protocol for one possible technique to do this with one pair of forceps.
6. Between CTDs (for instance, while you are filtering the underway) rinse your collection container three times with milliQ water or use a new collection container. Remember to unclamp the tube in the peristaltic pump.

#### Sample Preservation

1. Using a P1000 (1000 µL pipette), add 400 uL of DNA/RNA Shield preservative into the cryovial.
2. Place the cryovial in a -80ºC freezer as soon as possible.

#### Storage

1. Freeze at –80°C in a box with other samples until extraction.

#### Post-Sampling/Sterilization

- You do not need to sterilize all tubing and filter housings in between every sample, but you should try to clean periodically.
- Clean both the tubing and the filter housing by attaching the empty housing (without a filter) to the tubing.
- Clean the filter housings by placing the tops in one bag and the bottoms in another, soaking in bleach 15 minutes, then rinsing and shaking three times with milliQ water in the bag.
- Cleaning can entail:
  - Running bleach through the tubing and serological pipette for 10 minutes (both ends of the tube in the same bag, so it recirculates), then run milliQ water through the tubing and serological pipette for 20 minutes (one end of the tube in a different bag, so it does not recirculate and both ends are in bags instead of out in the air).
  - Running 1-2L sample water through the tubing and housing before adding in a filter.
  - Running 1-2L milliQ or DI water through the tubing and housing before sampling.
  - Running 500mL diluted (5-10%) bleach through tubing and housing, followed by running 2-3 L sample water to thoroughly rinse.
  - Adding 1-2L diluted bleach to the intermediate container (carboy), then rinsing thoroughly with DI water.
  - Wiping down the benches and other surfaces with 70% ethanol and/or DNAway.
- For every sample, allow the sample water to run through tubing for 5 minutes before adding a filter. This will flush any residual bleach and/or material from a previous sample.
- Do not allow bleach to go down the sink. Bleach can go in and out of its bottles and bags, and in the bleach waste carboy if it is dirty and you need to make new bleach.

#### Data records

- While filtering, record all the relevant information on the printed copy of the appropriate data sheet (underway vs CTD samples).
- Periodically (at least once per day) transcribe the written records into the electronic copy of the sample sheet.
- Full underway sample IDs should be as follows:
\<CRUISE-ID>_ \<LINENUMBER-TRANSECTNUMBER>_\<FILTER-NUMBER>
  - For example: RS2311\_LINE80-01\_F001
- Full CTD sample IDs should be labeled as follows:
\<CRUISE-ID>\_\<STATION>\_\<CTD-CAST>_\<FILTER-NUMBER>
  - For example: RS2311\_90-55\_C001_F002
- Cryovials can be labeled with the filter number only (F001 - FXXX)

### Quality control

**Negative Controls**
- During a transect or station, attach a filter in a filter housing to a tube in the peristaltic pump. Run MilliQ water from the ship through the same serological pipette and tube that other CTD samples have gone through for the duration of the station. Process filter the same way as the sample filters (steps 12-15 of underway filtration).

### Basic troubleshooting guide

**Filter clog**

If the filter clogs, end the sample and record whatever volume did make it through.

**Peristaltic pump not pumping**

If the peristaltic pump is making its normal noises but water is not coming out of the housing, here are some things you can do:
- Feel along the tube for leaks or cracks.
- Open the peristaltic pump clamp to see if the pump has chewed up the tube. Replace tube if needed.
- Look along the tube for compressed sections. If you see one, turn the speed down and massage the compressed section until it pops back into shape. Wait until water comes out to turn the speed up.
- Moving the tube so that a different section is clamped in the peristaltic pump regularly helps prevent damage and improve flow.

**Filters keep coming out torn**

If filters are torn when you open the filter housing to preserve them, try not tightening the housings quite as hard. Undertightening can lead to leaks, but overtightening can lead to filter tears.

**Filter housing is leaking**

Screw the housing together tighter. If the problem persists, try to screw it together straighter.

**Out of Whirlpak bags**

If you run out of whirlpak bags, fresh ziplock bags may be used for CTD sampling.
